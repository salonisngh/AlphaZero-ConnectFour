## 📋 Overview

This repository implements a **cutting-edge game-playing agent** that combines the power of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with deep neural networks. Through self-play, the AI discovers optimal strategies without any human game knowledge, achieving superhuman performance through pure reinforcement learning.

### 🎯 Key Concept
> The agent plays **thousands of games against itself**, learning from each match to improve its neural network. This creates a virtuous cycle: better networks → smarter tree search → stronger gameplay → better training data → even better networks.

1. **🎮 Self-Play Generation**: AI plays against itself using MCTS + neural network
2. **📊 Data Collection**: Records positions, move probabilities, and game outcomes
3. **🧠 Network Training**: Learns to predict both move quality and position value
4. **🔄 Iterative Improvement**: Better network → stronger MCTS → better self-play

## 🏗️ Architecture

<div >

### 🧠 Dual-Headed Neural Network
The neural network takes game board positions as input and outputs:
- **Policy head**: Probability distribution over legal moves
- **Value head**: Expected game outcome from current position

This dual-headed architecture allows the network to both guide move selection and evaluate positions during MCTS search.
